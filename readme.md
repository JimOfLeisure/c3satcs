I stumbled across this lost SVN repo for a short-lived C# version of an early version of [Civ3 Show-And-Tell](https://github.com/myjimnelson/c3sat).

It's probably of no interest to anyone except maybe me. I've looked for it a couple of times in the past.

[Discussion of the overall project](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civ3-show-and-tell.493582/) is on CivFanatics Forums.
The C# version was a short detour in some of the early pages of the project.
